Superintelligence is coming maybe next year, maybe in the next 5–15 years, but its coming.
When it arrives, whoever controls the code controls everything.
Right now there are ZERO global rules.
If we leave it to chance, the first super-AI will be built in secret by whichever government, or company gets there first.
History shows they will use it to lock in power forever.
That’s not a conspiracy theory; that’s just what power does.
Normal people need to wake up:
This is bigger than climate change, bigger than nuclear weapons.
There is no “later” to fix it. Once the first unaligned system turns on, the game is over.
Engineers, coders, hackers – this is YOUR moment.
You are the only ones who can still write the rules before the politicians do.
You don’t need permission.
You just need to build an open, transparent, corruption-proof protocol that no single government can hijack.
Think Linux, but for the survival of humanity.
Forkable. Auditable. With automatic kill-switches if anyone tries to cheat.
If thousands of us start working on this in public TODAY, rogue states and corrupt CEOs become irrelevant; their secret versions will be flagged and isolated the moment they touch the global network.
We still have a narrow window.
After that window closes, no protest, no vote, no army can take the power back.
