Why this is urgent

2025: Microsoft’s new topological qubit chip already at 8 qubits, roadmap to 1 000 000.
Multiple labs claim AGI “when the hardware is ready”.
Zero global treaties exist.
Once the first unaligned superintelligence wakes up, debate is over.

This is not a white-paper graveyard.
This is a living, forkable, enforceable protocol.
If you think any rule is stupid → fork and fix it.
If you think we’re all going to die anyway → prove the rules are insufficient.
