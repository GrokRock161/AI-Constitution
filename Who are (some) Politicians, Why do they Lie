Who Are Politicians? An Objective Overview
Politicians are individuals elected or appointed to hold public office, where they represent citizens, make decisions on policy, and influence laws and governance. 
Their primary roles include creating, debating, and voting on legislation; providing constituency services; conducting oversight and investigations; and acting as intermediaries between the public, government services, and other entities. In essence, they serve as leaders in democratic systems, balancing representation with decision-making authority. 
However, their actions are often shaped by the need to maintain power, respond to public opinion, and navigate complex political environments.
Why Do Politicians Deceive the Public?
Deception by politicians is a documented phenomenon across political systems, driven by a mix of psychological, strategic, and systemic factors. Key reasons include:

Belief in Impunity: Many politicians lie because they perceive low risk of consequences, often attributing falsehoods to media bias or misinterpretation, which allows them to maintain public support. Psychological factors, such as prioritizing perceived innocence over honesty (e.g., when polling data suggests it benefits their image), further enable this behavior.
Strategic Gain: Lies are used to score political points, stoke prejudice, or advance agendas, especially in polarized environments where fact-checking is undermined by social media and echo chambers. In international politics, leaders may deceive their own citizens more readily due to inherent trust, while using lies for national interest or fearmongering.
Selfish or Systemic Motivations: Deception can stem from personal traits like selfishness or narrow-mindedness, but it's also enabled by systemic issues, such as legal protections (e.g., First Amendment in the U.S. limiting punishment for lies). This has led to an "epidemic" of political lying, often resulting in harm to individuals or democratic institutions.

These patterns highlight that deception is not always malicious but often a calculated tool for power retention or policy advancement.
Why Do Politicians Often Use History as an Excuse?
Politicians frequently invoke history to legitimize actions, frame narratives, or deflect criticism, a practice known as the "use and abuse of history." This serves to rally support, justify controversial decisions, or obscure present-day motives. Common examples and reasons include:

Justifying Power Grabs or Authoritarianism: Historical events are cited as pretexts for restricting freedoms. For instance, the Nazis used the 1933 Reichstag fire to suspend civil liberties and consolidate power. Similarly, Adolf Hitler fabricated claims of Sudeten German deaths to justify invading Czechoslovakia in 1938.
Erasing or Rewriting Opponents: Leaders like Joseph Stalin attempted to expunge rivals such as Leon Trotsky from official records to control narratives and justify purges. In modern contexts, Vladimir Putin has distorted Russian history to rationalize aggression against Ukraine.
Excusing Corruption or Policy Failures: During the U.S. Gilded Age (1870–1900), politicians engaged in graft, rationalizing it by claiming corruption was too pervasive to resist. More recently, U.S. politicians have referenced historical voting practices to defend or attack restrictive laws. Globally, ethnic groups in post-colonial states have used selective histories to validate actions, including atrocities.
Broader Political Misuse: Figures like George W. Bush invoked history to support policies, often selectively, to align with current goals. This tactic exploits public trust in historical "lessons" to make actions appear inevitable or righteous, even when evidence is manipulated.

Implications for Engineers in AI Governance
For engineers working on technologies like superintelligence, understanding politicians' tendencies toward deception and historical manipulation is crucial. 
These behaviors could lead to AI systems being co-opted for nationalistic, corrupt, or self-serving ends—e.g., justifying surveillance as a "historical necessity" or deceiving the public about AI risks to maintain control. By recognizing this, engineers can prioritize transparent, open-source frameworks that resist such abuses, ensuring technology serves humanity rather than entrenched power structures.
