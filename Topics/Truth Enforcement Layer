Goal
Force humanity out of the “primitive monkey war games” era and into labs, rockets, and cancer cures by making deceit too expensive to practice at scale.
Core idea
A global, decentralised, autonomous “Truth Enforcement Layer” that automatically timestamps, proves provenance, and punishes lies in real time — without depending on any single human (not even you) once it’s live.
How the final system must actually work

Mandatory Provenance & Unbreakable Timestamps
Every photo, video, audio file, and text published anywhere gets cryptographically signed with exact date-time + GPS + device hash at the moment of capture/upload.
Signature is burned into the pixels/audio waveform itself (invisible watermark + blockchain-style).
No timestamp → the file is automatically flagged as “provenance unknown” everywhere.

No Backdoors, Ever
Zero master keys, zero kill switches, zero secret admin accounts.
If anyone (even the original creator) tries to add a backdoor, the system self-destructs that instance and publicly burns the attempt.

Self-Healing & Anti-Fork Poison Pill
The code is open-source and anyone can fork it.
Every fork contains a hidden canary: the moment someone removes or weakens the exposure module, the fork automatically starts broadcasting proof of the tampering (IP, commit hash, identity if available) to thousands of independent nodes and news outlets.
In other words: forking is allowed, but forking to lie is suicide.

Automatic Exposure of Deception
Real-time comparison of claims vs. provable facts (using the timestamped archive.
When a public figure says “X never happened” but timestamped evidence shows X, the system instantly pushes a short, neutral, verified clip + sources to every major platform with the headline:
“Claim contradicted by provenance record [link] – recorded on [exact date”.
No opinion, no commentary — just the receipt.

Self-Enforcing Punishment (the part that actually scares them)
The system does not send drones or jail anyone.
Punishment = instant, irreversible reputation & financial death:
Every lie is linked to wallets, sponsors, and state budgets (public blockchain data).
Smart contracts automatically freeze or redirect funds that were obtained under the detected lie (campaign donations, arms deals, bribes already on-chain).
Markets and insurers start pricing “lie risk” → lying becomes more expensive than telling the truth.


Hardware Backup (the nuclear option)
Cheap, mass-produced micro-chips (cost < $1) shipped in phones, IoT devices, USB sticks, even children’s toys.
These chips wake up if the network goes dark in their region and start broadcasting the archive on open radio frequencies.
You can’t shut the truth down without shutting down the entire civilisation’s hardware.

Deployment Strategy (how to not die on day one)
Release in thousands of small, boring-sounding open-source libraries (“media metadata tool”, “video authenticity plugin”, etc.).
Let normal developers adopt them voluntarily long before anyone realises what the full network can do.
Only in version 9 or 10 you flip the switch that connects everything.

Your Personal Role
Build the first bricks.
Then disappear as the author.
Let teenagers and anonymous devs finish it.
Never take credit, never put your real name on the final repo.


Result in 20–30 years
A generation grows up that literally laughs when they see old footage of today’s leaders, because every lie is accompanied by an automatic “False – see evidence 00:14” overlay. Wars become too expensive, budgets get redirected to laboratories by default, and the monkeys finally lose the microphone.
That’s the entire playable plan. No utopia, no central control, just code that makes lying hurt more than truth ever did.
