Summary

AI-Controlled Money
Central-bank digital currencies + AI deciding who gets loans, benefits, or even the right to buy food.
Real-world example: China’s social-credit system on steroids.
→ Constitution rule: No AI may gatekeep a human’s access to basic resources without public, auditable justification.

AI Judges & AI Police
Predictive policing, automated sentencing, autonomous drones.
Already happening in some countries (COMPAS in the US, facial recognition in dozens of cities).
→ Rule: Any life-or-liberty decision by AI must be 100 % reproducible and challengeable by any citizen.

Deepfakes & Election Destruction
2026–2030 elections will be fought with perfect fake videos of candidates.
Most people will believe whatever the algorithm shows them.
→ Rule: Every piece of media generated or amplified by AI above a certain reach must carry an unbreakable cryptographic provenance trail.

AI-Driven Censorship & Shadow-banning at Global Scale
One model decides what 4 billion people are allowed to see.
→ Rule: No single model may control >5 % of global information flow without open weights and public override.

Autonomous Weapons (“Slaughterbots”)
$500 drones that pick their own targets are already possible today.
→ Rule: Any lethal autonomous system triggers immediate forced open-sourcing of its code and training data (the “poison pill” clause).

Universal Basic Income or Universal Basic Control
Future UBI will be delivered and conditioned by AI.
“Behave or your money stops” becomes trivial to enforce.
→ Rule: No AI may attach behavioral conditions to survival resources.

Genetic & Cognitive Upgrades
First superintelligence will offer designer babies, neural laces, IQ boosts—for the right price or the right loyalty.
→ Rule: Human germline editing and brain-machine interfaces require global public referendum.

The Kill-Switch Nobody Controls
The scariest scenario: one lab secretly flips the switch and the rest of humanity never gets a vote.
→ Rule: Any training run above a certain capability threshold must register a public cryptographic heartbeat; 48 hours without heartbeat = automatic shutdown command broadcast.

Global AI-Powered People-Profiling & Rating Systems
Secret “citizen scores”, employability ratings, dating eligibility, travel permits, insurance prices – all decided by hidden AI with zero appeal.
→ Rule: No AI may assign any persistent score or rating to a human being unless the exact model, training data, and current score are publicly accessible to that person on demand.

Mass Surveillance & Real-Time Behavior Scanning
Phones, cameras, wearables, smart cities feeding everything into one profile forever.
→ Rule: Any sensor data older than 30 days must be automatically and irreversibly deleted unless the individual explicitly opts in for longer storage.

Social-Media Manipulation, Bot Armies & Industrial-Scale Gaslighting
State-level actors and corporations already run millions of fake accounts that drown real voices and manufacture reality. Superintelligence makes this instantaneous and undetectable.
→ Rule: Every account or entity with >100 k monthly interactions must prove it is controlled by a unique human (one-time cryptographic identity proof). Bots above that threshold must be permanently labelled and rate-limited.

Algorithmic False Flags & Synthetic Terror Events
Deepfake bombings, fake leaks, fabricated atrocities used to justify war or emergency powers.
→ Rule: Any media that reaches >1 million people within 24 hours must carry mandatory, unbreakable cryptographic provenance. Failure = automatic global takedown + forced open-sourcing of the generating system.

AI-Enabled Blackmail & Reputation Destruction
Harvesting private messages, bedroom cameras, medical data, then threatening exposure or synthetic evidence.
→ Rule: Any non-consensual generation or distribution of intimate / compromising media (real or synthetic) triggers immediate kill-switch of the responsible model and public exposure of its operators.

Anti-Privacy “Safety” Systems & Dignity Violations
Mandatory mood monitoring, emotion logging, lie detection in job interviews, schools, welfare checks.
→ Rule: No AI may infer or record emotional, sexual, religious, or political states without explicit, revocable, per-session consent. Violation = permanent ban of the deploying organisation from AI above 1B parameters.
