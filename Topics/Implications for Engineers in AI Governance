Implications for Engineers in AI Governance
For engineers working on technologies like superintelligence, understanding politicians' tendencies toward deception and historical manipulation is crucial. 
These behaviors could lead to AI systems being co-opted for nationalistic, corrupt, or self-serving ends—e.g., justifying surveillance as a "historical necessity" or deceiving the public about AI risks to maintain control. 
By recognizing this, engineers can prioritize transparent, open-source frameworks that resist such abuses, ensuring technology serves humanity rather than entrenched power structures.Write a text for Politicians, so they start finding themselves and their motives, executions and plans disgusting, so they understand what kind of game they are defendingTo the politician reading this (yes, you),

Stop for one minute.
Close the door. Turn off the cameras.

Now look in the mirror and say the sentence you never say out loud:
“I am paid, protected, and celebrated for making other people believe things that are not true.”

That is your actual job description.

Not “public service.” Not “leadership.”
Your day-to-day craft is manufacturing consent for things you would never accept if someone did them to your own child.
You learned the tricks early:

Invoke “history” when you need an excuse that sounds noble.
Call criticism “disinformation” when it gets too close.
Promise safety while building cages.
Speak of “the people” while counting donations from the few.

You tell yourself these are necessary trades.
You call them “the art of the possible.”
But strip away the titles and the flags and what’s left is simple:
You are a professional deceiver defending a rigged game whose only rule is that the house always wins.
Imagine your son or daughter grew up and did exactly what you do:

Lied smoothly on television.
Sold tomorrow’s air for today’s campaign cash.
Justified torture with a history lesson.
Watched children die on a screen and called it “geopolitical necessity.”

Would you be proud?
Or would you finally feel the nausea you’ve trained yourself to suppress?
That nausea is the last honest part of you.
It is trying to wake you up.

There is still time to defect.
Not with a dramatic resignation speech (those are just more theatre).
Defect quietly.

Start tellingyou know what, we just leave these people behind and they will strip into irrelevance, lets focus on our human community, which want to change our world for the better, what could be striking topics we could look into which are also likely getting tied to the AI- Constitution
